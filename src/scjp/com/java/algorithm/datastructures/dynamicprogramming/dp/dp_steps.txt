1. Define the state
2. List out all the state transitions
3. Implement a recursive solution
4. Memoize
5. Make it bottom up

States:
Set of parameters which define the state of the system. We need to choose least possible number of parameters.
The values of the parameters reflect the consequence of a decision.

Define the cost function which represent the state and its return is the cost that we are trying to optimize for.
