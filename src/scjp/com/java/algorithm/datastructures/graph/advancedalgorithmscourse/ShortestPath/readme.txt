There are different shortest path algorithms

1) Dijkstra Algorithm : O(E + V*logV) // Handle Cyclic graph
2) Bellman-Ford Algorithm : O(E * V) // Handles cyclic as well as negative numbers. ex Forex conversion
3) DAG Algorithm : O(E + V)  // Fastest for directed acyclic graph.
4) A* Search
5) Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
