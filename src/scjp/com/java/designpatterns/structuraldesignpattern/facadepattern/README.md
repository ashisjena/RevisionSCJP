Impose a policy upon a group of objects from above or from the client.
You are constraining the way the those objects communicate with each other or with the outside world.

The client doesn't see the group of objects. It sees the Facade and the facilities provided by the facade.

The Facade stands in for low level implementations providing a simpler, more constrained interface for the client to use.
This provides more safety more security and information hide.

With outside world constrain it's called Facade.
With in the objects it's called Mediator.
