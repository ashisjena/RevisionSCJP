The mediator is an object that works behind the scenes and sends messages to every object co-ordinating the behaviour.

It's kind of like a puppeteer.


A mediator works behind the scenes to impose a particular policy on a group of objects neither those objects nor the client 
of those objects knows that the mediator exists.

The mediator always remain hidden.
